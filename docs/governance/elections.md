#Elections

The core governance of Socket Network is based on elections. Hence, the Election plays an important role here.  All important decisions inside any shared community are based on elections in this app. The preferences inferred through Surveys may be pushed to elections for final implementation or rejection. 
{: .note }

Each election is always associated with a role. Roles are tied to access on chain.	 
For example, MAyor role in a city or the creator of a community in that Community. 

Each Election is a chain. Eligibility of voters is determined by subscriptions. Eligibility can be deligated to someone else. OR Sortition can be random users (like a jjury) who are compensated. Each ballot will have an owner and a deligate field. If the owner deligates then the deligated user can vote on their behalf. Who voted has to be recorded.
