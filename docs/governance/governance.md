# Governance
{: .no_toc }
 The current system, as you know is filled with numerous bad actors & most of them will get away with anything. Why is it like that you may wonder & the answer is simple. It's because of **lack of governance**. 

Let's take this scenario where you have contributed certain sum of money to some organisation or even your tax money for that matter. Now imagine this, what if the money you've donated or paid as tax is put on chain & you, as a user, has the ablilty to track where, for what purpose & how exactly is your money being utlised. If everyone can see it, the entire world will drastically change overnight. Wouldn't this be so cool ? 

Socket is built & designed to do all of it.
