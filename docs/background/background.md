### Socket network - A blockchain based decentralised social network. 

No matter what you do on Socket network, you will have complete control over your data privacy. Yes, you and you only, and nobody can violate your privacy. Socket is designed such that even we do not have the ability to access your data. It's evident that the current social networks have eroded trust in society. And we believe, the right to privacy is absolute. 

Hence, on Socket network, it's "Your device, Your Identities, Your Rules" that's it.

You maybe wondering, why should I switch from the current social network and how is so Socket network very different compared to others ?

### Networks 

## What is a Network ? 

In layman terms, a Network is simply, a set of humans, with whom that individual would likely interact at intervals to support a given set of activities.

Furthermore, Socket being a network, we belive that every community is a network. We also believe in Values. So, if we couple Networks, Communities and Values together, without a doubt it will change the entire perspective of the current society. Not just any values, we're talking about similar values of multiple people inside one community. 

There is so much potential so that, as more and more users join and become a part of Socket network, the world can be brought together and people from any nook and corner will be able to connect with other people.
