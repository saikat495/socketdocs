### Socket network - A blockchain based decentralised social network. 

No matter what you do on Socket network, you will have complete control over your data privacy. Yes, you and you only, and nobody can violate your privacy. Socket is designed such that even we do not have the ability to access your data. It's evident that the current social networks have eroded trust in society. And we believe, the right to privacy is absolute. 

Hence, on Socket network, it's "Your device, Your Identities, Your Rules" that's it.

You maybe wondering, why should I switch from the current social network and how is Socket network very different compared to others ?

## Networks 

### What is a Network ? 

In layman terms, a Network is simply, a set of humans, with whom individuals would likely interact at intervals to support a given set of activities.

Furthermore, Socket being a network, every community is a network and every community has set of Values. So, if we couple Networks, Communities and Values together, without a doubt it will change the entire perspective of the current society. Not just any values, we're talking about similar values of multiple people inside one community. 

There is so much potential so that, as more and more users join and become a part of Socket network, the world can be brought together and people from any nook and corner will be able to connect with other people. 

With so many advance features, it definitely calls for robust trust mechanism. 

## Trust

The whole of Socket network runs on Trust. Privacy is one aspect and then there's trust. Your account can be recovered by only those you trust the most in your circle, and who are your guardians.

### Nature of Trust

If you take a look around, Trust is something which is literally non existent in this world we live in. On Socket network, trust is everything and your network reflects a lot about you and with whom you associate with and your cicle. In this current system, scams are prominemt, albeit most of them claim to be genuine and legit. 

### Top Down Trust

### Community Driven Trust

Centralized trust is broken. You cannot trust your government, institutions, not even your money. Big tech is abusing its monopoly power. On Socket network it's all about connecting the world with Transparency, Trust and Truth with absolute Privacy. 

There is no such provision for trust in the current system and that is why most scams are prominent in any given aspect. If a community as a whole can vouch for something, then there's at least 80% chances that the veracity of certain piece of information has significantly more weightage. 

This also compliments for the individual's influence level. The more ratings a person receives, the more trust and influence is gained. The weightage of influence and trust is dependent on who rates the users. Different roles inside the communities give different weightage for the influence level.

To help you understand about community driven trust, let's quicky take a look at this scenario. 

Please note, this may not be accurate 100% of the times, but not all people are bad actors.

### Use case 1 

The recruiter of a company can ascertain the legitimacy of the candidates just by verifying the ratings awarded to the employees and the fact that the candidate was a part of the company's community. 

The users should note that, in case of jobs, every company community is a private community regardless of the type of the company and only employees can enter the company's community and gain access. Any other person who is not an employee can only view that community's profile page and cannot enter inside.

In this current system, there's no real provision to ascertain the legitimacy of certain information. On Socket network, we've aimed to smoothen and make peoples' life much easier.  

### Use case 2 

A invites B to join a private community X. Now that A is an active participant in the X community and everyone in X community knows what A's background is and also A's past history. Considering this, B is connected to A, hence B's authenticity and legitmacy can be assessed based on A. If A is belived to be a good actor, obviously his circle will more or less comprise of good actors. This may sound a bit intriguing and unfair, but ascertaining legitimacy on Socket network is not dependent soley in this manner. In order for B to become a part of community X will still be based on the votes by all the members of that community, albiet B is connected to A. 


## Identity

Identities, settings and roles are very much interlinked. Settings and roles are linked so much so that, without them identities have no weightage. 
{: .note }

An individual's username is the identity on Socket network. Your Identity is safeguarded no matter what community you join. Since Socket is community and network driven environment, the users are free to enter any communities using their desired identity. 

However, the users must note that for certain types of communtiies, they can only enter with their main profile username. Those communities would be Business, Jobs, Professional to name a few. Again, it's entirely upto the user to agree upon giving the details to enter the community.
