Now let's talk about the Apps inside each communities. 

Every community has set of Apps which are linked to each other and also acts in a unique way. On Socket network, all the apps are designed as if they  communicate with each other. 

### What are the different apps on Socket network ? 

Like mentioned above, all the apps are connected with each other. However, there are some apps which are exclusive for City communities only and certain Shared communities. This doesn't mean they are disconnected from each other. First let's see all the apps in Personal community : 

- Tasks 
- Conatacts
- Communities
- Calendar
- Jobs
- Wallets
- Treasury 
- Roles
- Relationships
- Identities
- Dating
- Checklists
- Elections
- Surveys
- Settings

 Now let's take an in - depth look at each of these 

- Tasks : Tasks and roles app are interlinked with each other. The tasks app is a default app for all types of communities. The users can create projects and sub divide further tasks inside the projects and assign it to other users. All the tasks can be assigned and designated on hierarchy basis. Tasks app on Socket network is extremely different compared to other apps out there. On Socket network, the admin of the task can set duration within which the tasks has to be marked done. In case if a particular task is not marked as done before the timeline, it automatically changes the state of that task from in progress to delayed.

Users are incentivised in Buxx for marking tasks as done and finishing them within the stipulated duration. Every task comes with different tiers of rewards based on its priority and complexity. The admin and even the users can track their progress from the beginning or even the progress of a standalone task. All the progress can be viewed on the charts and graphs and the users can compare their performance to others. 

- Contacts : Contacts is a very straight forward app where all connected users conatcts appears here. The users can go to the desired contacts and add guardians or set other relationship with their connections 

- Communities : This is a vital app on Sokcet network. Users will be able to see all the communities in which they are active. Upon joining a new community, it'll automatically show in this app. More details about a community can be viewed from here. And if the user desires to, they can create a new community community app.   

- Calendar : The users can create new events, save important meetings, dates and can add all their go to plans on the calendar app and set reminder for the same. There's an option to set start date and end date in case required. An event created on the calandar app can be made publicly viewable or share it with their connections in personal community or in a shared community. This acts as a potential source of discovery by gathering like minded and people with similar interests. 

- Jobs : In the previous sections we've mentioned about the smart matchmaking algorithm implemented on Socket network. In short Jobs app help in finding the perfect job based on the users skill. If a user is searching for a job and there's a requirement which matches the criteria, automatically the user and the job poster gets an alert for the same. 

In the current world, people seldom think on how to solve the problem of disconnected information between users, but rather just complain about it. On Socket network we've aimed to completely destroy the hollow space that currently exists between demand and supply side. 

- Wallets : An app that lets users manage their rewards and tokens. For the user, there's a default personal wallet in every shared community. Users can transfer the coins and rewards from shared community to their personal community if they desire to do so.

### What is the significance of wallets ? 

Being a Blockchain based Social network with coin rewards and tokens, wallets play a significantly important role on Socket network. Instead of having one single wallet in the personal community, the user can have multiple wallets in whatever community they are a part of and then transfer the coins and rewards to their personal wallet inside personal community. Multiple wallets concept is adopted to make it easy for people to manage all the tokens and rewards. 

### How does wallets work on Socket network ? 

The users can create as many wallets as they want in both Personal and Shared communities. One thing to note is that, by default every user gets a default personal wallet inside a shared communtiy upon entering. It's entirely upto the user to create more wallets if need be. All the rewards earned at the time of entering a community will directly go to the default wallet created by the system in the designated community. 

There's one thing the users should be aware of, that is, the admin / creator of a shared community should manually go the wallets app and create a designated wallet in the name of the community. This is different from the personal wallets which we spoke about in the above section. Community wallets lets the admin / creator of the community to allocate tokens to the members of that community. Wallets are linked to treasury.

- Treasury : On Socket network, treasury is like the Reserve / Federal bank of any community. Every community has a native token in that name inside the treasury. Not all the users in a shared community have access to the treasury nor can they view the contents inside the treasury. Only the creator / admin / owner of the community can access and handle the treasury.
