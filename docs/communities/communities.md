On Socket network, all users registering for the first time will be a part of their respective **City Communities**. 

### How are the City Communities created ? 

Socket uses the location of each user to automatically create a City Community.

### How does City Communities work ?

As mentioned above Socket uses the users location, so once a paritcular City Community is created, automatically other users who registers to Socket from the same GEO fence will be part of that particular City Community. 
On Socket network this is how each City Community is established. Users should also note that GEO Communities (i.e City Communities) are extremely unique. 

That said, on Socket network, communities are based on two types :


### 1. Personal Community:

A personal community is for an individual (adult). This is where a user sets their dear ones & trusted people in their network as guardians & they even start their own personal blog. 

Based on the type, every community, be it Personal or Shared has different types of apps. As we've mentioned in the overview section we strictly value your privacy. Hence, settings play a crucial role in Personal community. This is where the users control the visibility of fields in their profile page to public.


### 2. Shared Community:

This is also known as public community. The City community is an example for the shared community. A City community is a default community based on the geo fence. Hence, every user will be a member of the City community, in that particular city.
