# Communities
{: .no_toc }

How connected do you feel with your City ? Let's be honest, everyone has that special attachment towards their City, especially if it's their hometown. On Socket network, we've aimed to make sure to connect people from the same city, bring the city to life & strenghten that bond. Well, it's not just Cities, users can build communities for their neighbourhood, family & friends, fans, business, educational institutions & many more. This is not all, every community is governed by it's own **tokens**.

On Socket network, all users registering for the first time will be a part of their respective **City Communities**. 

### How are the City Communities created ? 

Socket uses the location of each user to automatically create a City Community.

### How does City Communities work ?

As mentioned above Socket uses the users location, so once a paritcular City Community is created, automatically other users who registers to Socket from the same GEO fence will be part of that particular City Community. 
On Socket network this is how each City Community is established. Users should also note that GEO Communities (i.e City Communities) are extremely unique. 

That said, on Socket network, communities are based on two types :


### 1. Personal Community:

A personal community is for an individual (adult). This is where a user sets their dear ones & trusted people in their network as guardians & they even start their own personal blog. 

Based on the type, every community, be it Personal or Shared has different types of apps. As we've mentioned in the overview section we strictly value your privacy. Hence, settings play a crucial role in Personal community. This is where the users control the visibility of fields in their profile page to public.


### 2. Shared Communities:

Shared Communities are of two types : Private Shared Communities & Public Shared Communities. 

Private Shared Communities are basically communities created by a user & thereafter inviting other users to join & become a part that community. In the aforementioned section of this article we've talked about City Communities, which also falls under Public Shared Communities. In fact, on Socket network, a community which is private initially has the privilage to go public and vice versa. 
**NOTE : A CITY COMMUNITY IS A PUBLIC SHARED COMMUNITY BY DEFAULT AND CANNOT GO PRIVATE**
