A community is created by a set of people having common interests / values / goals. 

Basically there are two type of communities.


### 1. Personal Community:

This is also known as the private community. You can control the users of this community as to who can join or who cannot join this community, hence the name.


### 2. Shared Community:

This is also known as public community. The City community is an example for the shared community. A City community is a default community based on the geo fence. Hence, every user will be a member of the City community, in that particular city, based on the user's geo location.
