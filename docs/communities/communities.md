# Communities
{: .no_toc }

How connected do you feel with your City ? Let's be honest, everyone has that special attachment towards their City, especially if it's their hometown. On Socket network, we've aimed to make sure to connect people from the same city in a very unique way, bring the city to life & strenghten that bond. Well, it's not just Cities, users can build communities for their Neighbourhood, Family & Friends, Fans, Businesses, Educational institutions & many more. This is not all, every community is governed by it's own **token(s)**.

On Socket network, all users registering for the first time will be a part of their respective **City Community**. 

### How are the City Communities created ? 

Socket uses the location of each user to automatically create a City Community.

### How does City Communities work ?

As mentioned above, Socket uses the users location, so once a paritcular City Community is created, automatically other users who register to Socket from the same GEO fence will be part of that particular City Community. 
On Socket network this is how each City Community is established. Users should also note that GEO Communities (i.e City Communities) are extremely unique. 

A user can enter a City Community as a Resident or a Visitor. If the user stays in a City Community for 180 days and satisfies that criteria, then he is regarded as a resident. The City Community in which the user lands at the time of registration will be considered as their hometown, albeit not a resident. Nevertheless the user has the option to manaully set their proper location as their hometown by visiting the desired place at a later date. 

If the user is a resident of a particular City, they will unlock the Token holders role in that City and will be able to participate in all the Elections and caste their Votes on important matters. As they should becuase they have the privilage to do so being a resident of that City.

The other scenario is, when a user is travelling and comes across multiple City Communities, the user has the option to enter that GEO Community as a Visitor. Unlike a Resident, being in a GEO Community as a visitor does not give complete access to all the features to that user. It's more like that user is a tourist in that City Community. 


That said, on Socket network, communities are of two types :


### 1. Personal Community:

A personal community is for an individual (adult). This is where a user sets their dear ones & trusted people in their network as guardians & they even start their own personal blog. 

Based on the type, every community, be it Personal or Shared has different types of apps. As we've mentioned in the overview section we strictly value your privacy. Hence, settings play a crucial role in Personal community. This is where the users control the visibility of fields in their profile page to public.


### 2. Shared Communities:

Shared Communities are further classified into : Private Shared Communities, Public Shared Communities and Quasi GEO Communtiies  

Private Shared Communities are basically communities created by a user & thereafter inviting other users to join & become a part of that community. In the aforementioned section of this article we've talked about City Communities, which also falls under Public Shared Communities. In fact, on Socket network, any Shared Community which is private initially has the privilage to go public and vice versa. 
**NOTE : A CITY COMMUNITY IS A PUBLIC SHARED COMMUNITY BY DEFAULT AND CANNOT GO PRIVATE WHATSOEVER**

Public Shared Communities are City Communities. A City community is much more unique compared Private communities. Users will be able to connect with other users from the same city and discover people with similar interests. It's not just for discovery, the City community is enormously powerful in uniting users from that city to bring reforms and also help in the betterment of the City as a whole. 

Quasi GEO Communtiies are very unique and there is no technology out there which has adopted something as sophisticated as this. Quasi GEO Communities are those communities which are visible to the users when they are on the move. 

### How does Quasi GEO Community work ?

Let's say when a user is travelling from point A to point E. During the commute, if there are several places B, C and D the user will be able to enter all those communities as a guest. The user is merely a tourist in those communities and does not have full access to all the features which are vested to a resident who is a Token holder. 


### What makes Socket network stand out from other social media apps ?

We live in a world where literally everything is disconnected and so are the apps on social media. On Socket network, Communities based on their types have different apps inside & those apps are connected with each other. It's as if the apps are talking to each other based on the user's activity. This enables the users to not only keep track of their activities, but also find and discover other users with similar interests and values. Basically each community is formed with a set of people having similar values and interests. 

On Socket network, we use smart matchmaking algorithm to help people discover communities and other users with similar values and also give them exactly what they are looking for based on the **Demographics**. The technology adopted on Socket network will help users in building a unique relationship with all the places they travel and differnt people they meet.
