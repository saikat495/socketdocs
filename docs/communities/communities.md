A community is created by a set of people having common interests / values / goals. 

Essentially on Socket network, communities are based on two types :


### 1. Personal Community:

A personal community is for an individual (adult). This is where a user sets their dear ones & trusted people in their network as guardians & they even start their own personal blog. 

Based on the type, every community, be it Personal or Shared has different types of apps. As we've mentioned in the overview section we strictly value your privacy. Hence Settings play a crucial role & in Personal community this is where the users control the visibility of fields in their profile page to public


### 2. Shared Community:

This is also known as public community. The City community is an example for the shared community. A City community is a default community based on the geo fence. Hence, every user will be a member of the City community, in that particular city, based on the user's geo location.
