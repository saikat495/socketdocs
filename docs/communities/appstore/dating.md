## Dating App

### Overall View

The Dating App is useful in match-making based on demographics and interests/requirements of the users. Each user's data on interest and hobbies are collected at the time of registering to the dating app. These are the parameters which are used for effective matchmaking.  It is a match if 2 users have at least 3 to 4 interests or hobbies in common between them. in addition to this interest matching, they should be located in the same or near by locality within a reachable radious. Example, finding people within 5-10 Kms radius is more useful, rather than finding a match from farther location of 100+ Kms or so, which will not be of much help.
