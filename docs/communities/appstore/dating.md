## Dating App

### Overall View

The Dating App is useful in match making based on demographics and interests/requirements of the users. Each user's data on interest and hobbies are collected at the time of registering. These are the parameters which are used for effective matchmaking.  It is a match if 2 people have at least 3to 4 common interests or hobbies. in addition to this interest matching, they should be located in the same or near by locality. Example, finding people within 5-10 kms radius is more useful, rather than finding a match from farther location of 100 kms or so, which will not be of much help.
