Now let's talk about the Apps inside each communities. 

Every community has set of Apps which are linked to each other and also acts in a unique way. On Socket network, all the apps are designed as if they  communicate with each other. 

### What are the different apps on Socket network ? 

Like mentioned above, all the apps are connected with each other. However, there are some apps which are exclusive for City communities only and certain Shared communities. This doesn't mean they are disconnected from each other. First let's see all the apps  

| Apps list    |
|:-------------|
| Tasks        | 
| Conatacts    | 
| Communities  | 
| Calendar     | 
| Conatacts    |
| Wallets      |
| Treasury     |
| Roles        |
| Relationships|
| Identities   |
| Dating       |
| Elections    |
| Surveys      |
| Settings     |


Let's take an in - depth look at each of these 

- Tasks : Tasks and roles app are interlinked with each other. The tasks app is a default app for all types of communities. The users can create projects and sub divide further tasks inside the projects and assign it to other users. All the tasks can be assigned and designated on hierarchy basis. Tasks app on Socket network is extremely different compared to other apps out there. On Socket network, the admin of the task can set duration within which the tasks has to be marked done. In case if a particular task is not marked as done before the timeline, it automatically changes the state of that task from in progress to delayed.

Users are incentivised in Buxx for marking tasks as done and finishing them within the stipulated duration. Every task comes with different tiers of rewards based on its priority and complexity. The admin and even the users can track their progress from the beginning or even the progress of a standalone task. All the progress can be viewed on the charts and graphs and the users can compare their performance to others. 

- Contacts : Contacts is a very straight forward app where all connected users conatcts appears here. The users can go to the desired contacts and add guardians or set other relationship with their connections 

- Communities : This is a vital app on Sokcet network. Users will be able to see all the communities in which they are active. Upon joining a new community, it'll automatically show in this app. More details about a community can be viewed from here. And if the user desires to, they can create a new community community app.   

- Calendar : The users can create new events, save important meetings, dates and can add all their go to plans on the calendar app and set reminder for the same. There's an option to set start date and end date in case required. An event created on the calandar app can be made publicly viewable or share it with their connections in personal community or in a shared community. This acts as a potential source of discovery by gathering like minded and people with similar interests. 

- Jobs : In the previous sections we've mentioned about the smart matchmaking algorithm implemented on Socket network. In short Jobs app help in finding the perfect job based on the users skill. If a user is searching for a job and there's a requirement which matches the criteria, automatically the user and the job poster gets an alert for the same. 

In the current world, people seldom think on how to solve the problem of disconnected information between users, but rather just complain about it. On Socket network we've aimed to completely destroy the hollow space that currently exists between demand and supply side. 

- Wallets : An app that lets users manage their rewards and tokens. For the user, there's a default personal wallet in every shared community. Users can transfer the coins and rewards from shared community to their personal community if they desire to do so.

### What is the significance of wallets ? 

Being a Blockchain based Social network with coin rewards and tokens, wallets play a significantly important role on Socket network. Instead of having one single wallet in the personal community, the user can have multiple wallets in whatever community they are a part of and then transfer the coins and rewards to their personal wallet inside personal community. Multiple wallets concept is adopted to make it easy for people to manage all the tokens and rewards. 

### How does wallets work on Socket network ? 

The users can create as many wallets as they want in both Personal and Shared communities. One thing to note is that, by default every user gets a default personal wallet inside a shared communtiy upon entering. It's entirely upto the user to create more wallets if need be. All the rewards earned at the time of entering a community will directly go to the default wallet created by the system in the designated community. 

There's one thing the users should be aware of, that is, the admin / creator of a shared community should manually go the wallets app and create a designated wallet in the name of the community. This is different from the personal wallets which we spoke about in the above section. Community wallets lets the admin / creator of the community to allocate tokens to the members of that community. Wallets are linked to treasury.

- Treasury : On Socket network, treasury is like the Reserve / Federal bank of any community. Every community has a native token in that name inside the treasury. Not all the users in a shared community have access to the treasury nor can they view the contents inside the treasury. Only the creator / admin / owner of the community can access and handle the treasury. 

- Roles : Roles app acts differently in differnt types of community. In a Private shared community, Roles app enables the admin / creator of the community to create a designated role and assign it to the members of that community. Every role has powers as designated to them by the admin / creator of that community.

- Relationships: Relationships app are limited to only Personal community and not for Shared communities. The users can set custom relationship(s) with all their connections only inside Personal community. 

### How does Relationships app work on Socket network ? 
 
On Socket network, users will be able to set multiple relationships with their connections. We cannot stress the significance of the Relationships app enough. This is the core aspect of trust on Socket network. Users are mandatorily required to set 6 trustworthy people in their circle as guardians. It is the guardians who plays a very important role in recovering and restoring your Socket account, if you lose access to it. We advice users to set only those people who they trust the most in their circle as their Guardians. The users can set other users as Guardians only if the other user(s) are on Socket.

That aside, now let's see other relationship types. 

| Relationships |
|:------------- |
| acquaintance  |
| Creator       | 
| Manager       | 
| Guardian      |
| Custom        | 

Besides Guardians, no other relationships has the access to recover the account.

- Identities : 

- Dating : On Socket network, this is not your average dating app. Unlike all other dating apps, we've aimed to make the users life as easy as possible to find the perfect match. A smart matchmaking engine where the algorithm enables the users to find profiles which are best suited after scanning and matching common interests. 

- Checklists : Checklists act like a reminders app and the users can create lists and share it with their connections if they desire to do so. 

- Elections : The core governance and the heart of Socket network lies in the Elections app. On Socket network users should note that not all voting are of the same type. Voting is based on each community type and there are 3 differnt types of voting i.e Quadratic, Conviction and Simple.  

To help you understand better about Elections, we highly recommend you first read about roles section and the aforementioned Treasury, Wallets Roles apps.

- Surveys : Surveys app is available on both Personal and Shared communities. Hosting Surveys can help understand the behaviour and preference pattern of users inside the Shared communities. Even so in Personal community, if the user has more number of connections, they can host surveys to learn more about the preferences of their connections. 

Users should note that Surveys and Elections are not the same. Elections have more weightage and Surveys are just casual questionaires. 
{: .note }

- Settings : The crucial part of Privacy on Socket network is in Settings app. Settings app is available on both Personal and Shared communities as a default app. The functioning aspect of Settings app is qwite different, albeit available on both the Communities. 

### How does Settings app work in Personal community ? 

Users inside their Personal community will be able to control who can see which part of their profile information. Say for example, if the user wants to hide the photos inside their Personal community from being visible to everybody on Socket network, they can simply navigate to the settings app set their preference as to who can view. It's totally upto the user to hide or keep the fields visbible. 

### How does Settings app work in Shared community ? 
 
Unlike Personal community, only the admin / Creator / Owner of the community will be able to access the Settings app. But, here's the catch, Settings inside a Shared community is linked to Elections app. Though settings is access based only, any changes made inside the settings app takes effect only after the users inside that Shared community **VOTES**. This is where we give the people to choose what is best for them and their community. 

Now, if a user desires to enter a Shared community, the Admin / Creator / Owner having access to Settings app will have the power to set the restrictions or conditions before anyone can join that community. What this means is that, for any Shared community except the City community, at the time of joining, the users will have to go through an additional step where they agree to enter into that community with the required profile fields. 

Some profile fields maybe Mandatory, Optional or Verified depending on the settings as chosen by the Admin / Creator / Owner of that community. It is entirely upto the users to enter or deny if they feel like they don't want to reveal certain information. Please note that it is entirely dependent on the type of community. 

SETTINGS IS A DEFAULT APP AND CANNOT BE DELETED IN EITHER OF THE COMMUNITIES.
