## Tasks and Project Management

The Tasks app is embedded with the *Project Management* feature in it. Also, the Tasks and roles app are inter-linked with each other. The tasks app is a default app for all types of communities. The users can create projects and sub divide the projects into sub-projects and further create tasks inside the projects and assign it to the team members/users. All the tasks can be assigned and designated based on hierarchy. Tasks app on Socket network is extremely different when compared with other apps out there in the market. On Socket network, projects can be created under tasks app and assigned to people. The project manager creates tasks in accordance to the project and assigns the tasks to his team. The project manager can set the duration to the tasks assigned. The assignee of the task has to complete the task within the stipulated duration and has to mark it as done. After starting the project, in case if a particular task is not marked as 'done', or completed before the time allocated to it, the socket automatically changes the state of that task from 'in progress' to 'delayed' and an alert is sent to both the task owner and the project manager. This helps the project manager to intervene and clear the bottleneck, if any.

Users are motivated by incentivising in Buxx for finishing the tasks within the stipulated time span. Every task comes with different tiers of rewards based on its priority and complexity. The progress of each task can be tracked right from the assignee (owner) of the task to his/her superiors/higherups in the orderof line of reporting. Also, the progress of the task/ the project can be viewed on the analytics charts and/or graphs, and the users can compare their performance with each others in their team. This helps in creating a competitiveness amongst the team members, teams, and departments, thereby motivating them to perform better. 

### Project management from Standalone user point of view :  

Under the standalone project (or any standalone task), the tasks are not visible to anyone else other than the owner of the tasks. For example, the self assigned private tasks. 

### Project management from all the users in one sprint point of view:

Here, in a sprint, all the tasks are visible to all the users of that particular sprint. Each member of the sprint can see which task has been assigned to whom and how many are in-progress, done, or pending to work on.
