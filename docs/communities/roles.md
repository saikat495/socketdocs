### Introduction about Roles on Socket network.

Roles are classified into : Delegated role, Elected role, Ticketed role

Delegated roles can be fired and Elected roles need impeachment vote. Users should note Identities can be elected to a role or admin can bestow a role upon an identity. Elected roles can be created by elections. Ticketed roles have expiry. The users must note that Deligated roles have subset of power from deligator role.


### How does Elections app work on Socket network ? 

To help you understand about Elections, we highly recommend you first read about roles and the aforementioned Treasury, Wallets Roles apps.

Inside the Elections app there are 4 tabs namely : Elections, Nominations, Candidates, Votes and Results respectively. Let' see the significance of each of them.

So, Elections app is directly linked with Treasury, Wallets and Roles apps. No other members besides the Admin / Creator / owner or any other members with designated role to access the treasury in a Shared community will be able to see the contents inside the Treasury. Hence, if any of the aforementioned users try to make a transaction specifically from the Treasury, the app automatically triggers an Election to all the **TOKENHOLDERS** inside that Shared community. 

Essentially every user inside a GEO (City Community) is a token holder. When they enter their respective GEO communities, the users are awarded in the City coins, so they automatically become the **TOKENHOLDERS**. In all the City communities, there's a designated role for "Mayor" and only Mayors have access to the treasury. Any transactions coming from that City community's treasury will trigger an Election to all the members inside that City communities. 

Now you maybe wondering how do Mayor occupy their roles ? Simple, the users inside the CIty community will Elect the Mayor to occupy that role. In fact, those users who brings the Mayor to Socket App will be rewarded in BUXX and that user who brought the Mayor will be recognised and rewarded in the that City community. In addition, they'll also increase their influence level in that GEO community.

But, what happens to the previous Mayor who held the Mayor's role, but their term is expiring ? It's the members of that City community who has the ability to Nominate the subsequent candidates for the next term. A Mayor can hold their role for up to 5 years before their term expires. If the Mayor has support from the members of that City community, the users can nominate the same person again.  

### Elections for transactions 

Elections app is directly linked with Treasury, Wallets and Roles apps. No other members besides the Admin / Creator / owner or any other members with designated role to access the treasury in a Shared community will be able to see the contents inside the Treasury. Hence, if any of the aforementioned users try to make a transaction specifically from the Treasury, the app automatically triggers an Election to all the **TOKENHOLDERS** inside that Shared community. 

The users can either check the elections and vote for it from the alerts tab on the feed or if they wish to see the past elections, they can simply navigate to the Elections app and check for the details of all the past elections.
