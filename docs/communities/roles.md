### Introduction about Roles on Socket network. 

Every user on Socket network by default occupies a Role. The most common role is **TOKEN HOLDERS ROLE**. The whole of Socket network is built on Privacy, Trust, Roles, Access and Elections. Roles control the power structure within a community. Only certain types of roles can create other roles.

Roles are classified into : Delegated role, Elected role, Ticketed role

Delegated roles can be fired and Elected roles need impeachment vote. Users should note Identities can be elected to a role or admin can bestow a role upon an identity. Elected roles can be created by elections. Ticketed roles have expiry. The users must note that Delegated roles have subset of power from deligator role.

### Roles inside Personal community 

Roles and Relationships are linked to each other. Inside every Personal community, an individual to individual can set these relationships : 
           
| Acquantance|
|Guardian    |
| Family     |
| Friend     |
| Colleague  |
| Boss       |
| Subordinate|
| Classmate  |
| Spouse     |
| Significant Other |
| Girl Friend |
| Boy Friend |
| Neighbor   |
| Custom     |

Only **GUARDIANS** are classified into both Role and Relationship and the rest of them are conisdered as standalone Relationships. Guardians role the most important because they are the ones who help in restoring and recovering your account. Users can navigate to Relationships app and set the role as Guardians.

### Roles inside the City community

Users can enter into a City community and have : Resident role, Visitors role. 

Users are asked for the option to either select their role as a resident or a visitor when they enter a particular GEO community. A user's residential status is then finalised by the duration of their stay inside a particular city, albeit selecting the options manually.  

Only Residents of the City community has the power to vote on matters which are crucial to that City community.

Unlike other communities we consider the City community as a very special and unique community. Hence, the most important role inside the City community will be a "Mayor" role. Mayor can later create as many roles as they desire to the respective users. As we've mentioned in the introduction of this article, a Mayor's role wil only be an Elected role.  

Roles and Elections go hand in hand, so let's see how a Mayor will occupy the Mayor's role inside a City community. Im this section we've explained in depth about the functioning of Elections app. 

### How does Elections app work on Socket network ? 

Elections app consists of : Elections, Nominations, Candidates, Votes and Results respectively. The users can either check the elections and vote for it from the alerts tab on the feed or if they wish to see the past elections, they can simply navigate to the Elections app and check for the details of all the past elections.  


### In case of a Transaction 

So, Elections app is directly linked with Treasury, Wallets, Roles and Settings apps. No other members besides the Admin / Creator / owner or any other members with designated role to access the treasury in a Shared community will be able to see the contents inside the Treasury. Hence, if any of the aforementioned users try to make a transaction specifically from the Treasury, the app automatically triggers an Election to all the **TOKENHOLDERS** inside that Shared community.  

Essentially every user inside a GEO (City Community) is a token holder. When they enter their respective GEO communities, the users are awarded in the City coins, so they automatically become the **TOKENHOLDERS**. In all the City communities, there's a designated role for "Mayor" and only Mayors have access to the treasury. Any transactions coming from that City community's treasury will trigger an Election to all the members inside that City communities. 

### How does Mayor occupy their role in the City community ?

The users inside the CIty community will Elect the Mayor to occupy that role. In fact, the user who brings the Mayor to Socket App will be rewarded in BUXX and will be recognised in the that City community. In addition, they'll also increase their influence level in that GEO community.

As far as the Mayor's veracity is concered, it will be totally decided by the users of that City community. You maybe wondering, what if somehow a random user claims the Mayor role ? Fret not, sooner or later their influence and connections will reveal the genuinity of that user.

### What happens to the existing Mayor ? 

Another scenario where there's already a Mayor and their term is expiring. The users of that City community has the ability to Nominate the new candidates for the next term. A Mayor can hold their role up to their tenure as decided by the users of that community based on the location. And all the token holders of that community will receive an alert before the expiry of the Mayor's term. If the Mayor has support from the members of that City community, the users can nominate the same person again.  

It is up to the Residents to exercise their due deligenc and in case of any misconducts or abuse of the power by the Mayor, the Residents of the City community can call for impeachment of the Mayor. Again, the veracity of the information will be carried by the Residents of that City community.
