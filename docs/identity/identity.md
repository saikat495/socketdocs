Identity is an unique set of characters of an individual or a community through wihich the person or the community is identified/recognised.
{: .note }


The identity can be based on three attributes, 

The identity of an individual or a community is through wihich the person or the community is identified/recognised. The identity is based on three attributes, 

*1) Inherrited attributes :* Height, Weight, colour etc of an individual or the size of the office space etc.,

*2) Cumulative attributes :* Here, the acquired attributes like the total number of likes, the buying / shopping history of an individual etc., and 

*3) Cumulated attributes :*  Here the attribute of an individual or of a community is added up over a period of time. 

In general, identity often refers to a person's / a community's unique individuality, meaning how they view themself as compared to other people/ community, based on the attributes / characteristics which identifies them in standing out from other individuals or communities. 


The identity acts as a passport (Self declared but verified and authenticated by others) to enter different communities or to get in contact with others. 
Community specific identity is granted by community and cannot be used elsewhere.
Identity given by any member or a person in contact, must be verified and authenticated by the other members / other contacts.
Identify in a gevernment community is to be verified and authenticated by the government.

Because of the multilevel verification and authentication by others, it makes the socket identity a unique and powerful feature which is more reliable and trustworthy in nature. 

In socket, different Apps require different parts of the identities. Entering a community with certain profile information as sought by the admin of that community has to be addressed individually on a case to case basis and in agreement with the profile owner as opted in settings.

For example, if one is looking for a dating partner and the person does not want to disclose his basic identity, then while entering the dating app, it asks for choice of his/her name as to be shown to the other users/ proposed partners of the dating app. The fields like address, education, experience, phone number etc are kept hidden from the other users of the dating app. This is to maintain the user's confidentiality and to safegaurd the real identity of the user as per his/her requirement. 

Similarly, while using the jobs  app, the fields like the name, address, education, experience, skills etc are taken in as mandatory fields as per the basic requirement for the use of that app. Without these field details, the user will not be able to see or apply to any kind of job vacancy.

In ecommerce app, the information on education or the experience of the user are not mandatory to disclose to continue the purchase and hence these fields would be hidden from the sellers/other users in the ecommerce app. 

Hence, based on the requirement of the apps, the profile can be categorized as Personal, Professional, Dating, and Public profiles.

*Persponal Profiles* are visible to the owner alone. Here, there will be additional / personal / confidential / vital informations like height, weight, colour, blood group, Blood Pressure, Drug allergies, shoe size, food preferences, likes and dislikes, habits, etc, which need not be shared with anyone unless required by the owner. This profile also contains the demographic details of the owner including the details of his activity on Socket. 
The *Professional Profiles* contain informations like the real name of the person, address, education, expereince, skills, expertise, awards and accolades won, References, etc which help the person in his professional career.
The *Dating Profiles* contain very basic informations like the pseudo name of the user (as chosen by him to show to other members of the dating community), Age (may not be the real one), place/location, gender, etc as required by the app.
The *Public Profile* is required to have an identity in a public community like a City Community, where a nick name, location of the city is shown and all other details are hidden or shown as per the requirement of the user.
